# Hardware Folder Structure

## Files

- `hardware/bom-list.md` - procurement-ready BOM checklist (quick buy/use)
- `hardware/bom.md` - detailed BOM with alternatives and phased procurement
- `hardware/pin-mapping.md` - board and signal pin mappings

## Subfolders

- `hardware/schematics/` - schematics and related notes

## Recommended Workflow

1. Buy against `hardware/bom-list.md`.
2. Track substitutions and alternatives in `hardware/bom.md`.
3. Update `hardware/pin-mapping.md` if component variants change.

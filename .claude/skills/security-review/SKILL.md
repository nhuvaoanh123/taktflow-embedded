# Security Review

Perform a security audit on the specified files or directories. If no argument given, audit `firmware/src/`.

## Checklist

### 1. Banned Functions
Search for unsafe C functions that are prohibited by project rules:
- `gets()`, `strcpy()`, `sprintf()`, `strcat()`, `atoi()`, `system()`
- Report each occurrence with file and line number

### 2. Hardcoded Credentials
Search for patterns indicating hardcoded secrets:
- String literals assigned to variables named password, secret, key, token, api_key
- Base64-encoded strings in source code
- URLs containing credentials

### 3. Input Validation
For each external interface handler (serial, MQTT, BLE, HTTP):
- Verify input length is checked before processing
- Verify buffer bounds are validated
- Verify data is validated against schema/whitelist before use

### 4. Memory Safety
Check for:
- Unchecked malloc/calloc return values
- Missing null pointer checks before dereference
- Buffer operations without size limits
- Use-after-free patterns

### 5. Cryptography
Verify:
- TLS is used for all network communication (no plaintext)
- Certificate verification is not disabled
- OTA update signatures are verified
- Appropriate key sizes and algorithms

### 6. Error Handling
Check that:
- All function return values are checked
- Errors propagate up (not silently swallowed)
- No sensitive data in error messages

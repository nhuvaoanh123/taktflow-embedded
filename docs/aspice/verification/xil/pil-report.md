# Processor-in-the-Loop (PIL) Test Report

<!-- Phase 12 deliverable -->

## Purpose

Validate real-time behavior on target MCU with simulated plant via CAN bridge.

## Configuration

- 1+ STM32 on real CAN bus
- CANable on PC bridges to plant simulator
- Remaining ECUs simulated

## Test Scenarios

| Scenario | Target MCU | Real-Time Met | CAN Jitter |
|----------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| — | — | — | — |

## SIL vs PIL Comparison

| Metric | SIL | PIL | Delta |
|--------|-----|-----|-------|
| Loop time | — | — | — |
| CAN latency | — | — | — |

## Results

<!-- To be completed in Phase 12 -->

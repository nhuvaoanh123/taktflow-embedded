## Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Comment Lock

`HITL` means human-reviewer-owned comment content.

**Marker standard (code-friendly):**
- Markdown: `<!-- HITL-LOCK START:<id> -->` ... `<!-- HITL-LOCK END:<id> -->`
- C/C++/Java/JS/TS: `// HITL-LOCK START:<id>` ... `// HITL-LOCK END:<id>`
- Python/Shell/YAML/TOML: `# HITL-LOCK START:<id>` ... `# HITL-LOCK END:<id>`

**Rules:**
- AI must never edit, reformat, move, or delete text inside any `HITL-LOCK` block.
- Append-only: AI may add new comments/changes only; prior HITL comments stay unchanged.
- If a locked comment needs revision, add a new note outside the lock or ask the human reviewer to unlock it.


# Stakeholder Requirements

## 1. Purpose

This document captures the stakeholder needs and expectations for the Taktflow Zonal Vehicle Platform per Automotive SPICE 4.0 SYS.1 (Requirements Elicitation). It translates stakeholder intentions into structured, verifiable requirements that serve as the basis for system requirements analysis (SYS.2).

The stakeholder requirements define WHAT the stakeholders want the system to achieve, without prescribing HOW. They are expressed in stakeholder language and are traceable to the system requirements that refine them.

## 2. Stakeholders

| ID | Stakeholder | Role | Interest |
|----|-------------|------|----------|
| SH-01 | Portfolio Reviewer | Evaluator | Assesses ISO 26262, ASPICE, and AUTOSAR competence through delivered work products |
| SH-02 | Automotive Hiring Manager | Decision Maker | Evaluates candidate's ability to perform as a Functional Safety Engineer or Embedded Systems Engineer |
| SH-03 | System Integrator | Technical | Requires clear interfaces, testable requirements, and reproducible build and demo processes |
| SH-04 | Vehicle Operator (Demo) | End User | Operates the bench platform during demonstrations; expects predictable behavior and clear feedback |
| SH-05 | Safety Assessor | Auditor | Reviews safety work products for completeness, consistency, and ISO 26262 compliance |
| SH-06 | Service Technician | Maintenance | Diagnoses faults using UDS tools, reads/clears DTCs, and validates system health |

## 3. Referenced Documents

| Document ID | Title | Version |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| ITEM-DEF | Item Definition | 1.0 |
| HARA | Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment | 1.0 |
| SG | Safety Goals | 1.0 |
| FSR | Functional Safety Requirements | 1.0 |
| FSC | Functional Safety Concept | 1.0 |

## 4. Requirement Conventions

Each requirement follows this structure:

- **ID**: STK-NNN (sequential)
- **Title**: Descriptive name
- **Priority**: Must (mandatory for core demo), Should (expected for completeness), May (desirable enhancement)
- **Source**: Stakeholder ID (SH-01 through SH-06)
- **Status**: draft | reviewed | approved
- **Description**: "Shall" language defining the need

## 5. Portfolio Demonstration Requirements

### STK-001: ISO 26262 Full Safety Lifecycle Demonstration

- **Priority**: Must
- **Source**: SH-01, SH-02
- **Status**: draft

The platform shall demonstrate competence with the full ISO 26262 safety lifecycle from item definition (Part 3) through safety validation (Part 4), including HARA, safety goals, functional safety concept, technical safety concept, software and hardware safety requirements, safety analyses (FMEA, DFA), and a structured safety case. All work products shall be structured to the level of completeness expected in a production ASIL D project.
<!-- HITL-LOCK START:COMMENT-BLOCK-15 -->
> **Why:** STK-001 is the anchor stakeholder requirement for this portfolio: hiring/reviewer stakeholders need evidence of end-to-end ISO 26262 lifecycle competence, not isolated coding tasks.
> **Tradeoff:** keeping this requirement lifecycle-wide strengthens portfolio credibility, but increases documentation and traceability workload across all phases.
> **Alternative:** narrow STK-001 to a subset (for example concept + implementation only), which reduces effort but weakens assessor/hiring signal for full functional-safety capability.
<!-- HITL-LOCK END:COMMENT-BLOCK-15 -->

---

### STK-002: ASPICE Level 2 Process Maturity Demonstration

- **Priority**: Must
- **Source**: SH-01, SH-05
- **Status**: draft

The platform shall demonstrate Automotive SPICE Level 2 process maturity across the system engineering (SYS.1 through SYS.5), software engineering (SWE.1 through SWE.6), and support (SUP.1, SUP.8) process areas. Each process area shall produce the defined work products with bidirectional traceability between requirements, architecture, implementation, and verification.

<!-- HITL-LOCK START:COMMENT-BLOCK-16 -->
> **Why:** STK-002 ensures the project is evaluated as an engineering process capability (planning, traceability, verification discipline), not only as a technical prototype.
> **Tradeoff:** targeting ASPICE maturity increases process/document overhead and slows raw implementation speed, but improves governance credibility and repeatability.
> **Alternative:** treat ASPICE as informal guidance only, which reduces workload short-term but weakens evidence quality for assessor/hiring expectations.
<!-- HITL-LOCK END:COMMENT-BLOCK-16 -->

---

### STK-003: AUTOSAR-like BSW Architecture Demonstration

- **Priority**: Must
- **Source**: SH-01, SH-02
- **Status**: draft

The platform shall implement an AUTOSAR Classic-like layered basic software (BSW) architecture with the following modules: MCAL (CAN, SPI, ADC, PWM, Dio, Gpt), ECU Abstraction (CanIf, PduR, IoHwAb), Services (Com, Dcm, Dem, WdgM, BswM, E2E), and RTE. The architecture shall demonstrate the separation of concerns between application software components and BSW modules.

<!-- HITL-LOCK START:COMMENT-BLOCK-17 -->
> **Why:** STK-003 exists to demonstrate AUTOSAR-style architectural competence (layering, interface boundaries, separation of concerns) without requiring full commercial AUTOSAR licensing/toolchain overhead.
> **Tradeoff:** AUTOSAR-like BSW gives strong architecture and process signal at lower cost, but does not provide formal AUTOSAR conformance/certification claims.
> **Alternative:** use a full AUTOSAR Classic stack/tooling for higher conformance fidelity, accepting significant cost, setup complexity, and reduced project finishability.
<!-- HITL-LOCK END:COMMENT-BLOCK-17 -->

---

### STK-004: Diverse Redundancy and Multi-Vendor Safety Architecture

- **Priority**: Must
- **Source**: SH-01, SH-02, SH-05
- **Status**: draft

The platform shall demonstrate a diverse redundancy architecture using at least two different MCU vendors for safety-critical and zone control functions. The independent safety monitoring function shall use a lockstep CPU from a different vendor than the zone controllers to provide hardware-diverse fault detection.

<!-- HITL-LOCK START:COMMENT-BLOCK-18 -->
> **Why:** the board choice (STM32G474RE Nucleo for zone ECUs + TI TMS570 LaunchPad for Safety Controller) was made to maximize architectural learning signal per cost: mixed-vendor diversity, lockstep safety monitor path, and fast prototyping availability.
> **Tradeoff:** these boards are practical and affordable, but they are development platforms (not production automotive ECUs), so the diversity claim remains architecture-level until bench measurements validate timing, fault detection, and independence behavior.
> **Alternative:** use automotive production-grade ECUs/MCUs for stronger hardware realism and conformance confidence, accepting significantly higher cost, tooling complexity, and longer bring-up time.
<!-- HITL-LOCK END:COMMENT-BLOCK-18 -->

---

## 6. Functional Requirements

### STK-005: Drive-by-Wire Function

- **Priority**: Must
- **Source**: SH-04, SH-03
- **Status**: draft

The platform shall provide a drive-by-wire function that converts operator pedal input into proportional motor torque. The pedal input shall be sensed using dual redundant sensors, and the system shall detect disagreement between the two sensors and transition to a safe state when plausibility checks fail.

<!-- HITL-LOCK START:COMMENT-BLOCK-19 -->
> **Why:** STK-005 is intentionally simple because SYS.1 captures stakeholder WHAT (expected behavior + safety outcome), while technical HOW (thresholds, timing, diagnostics, implementation) is allocated to SYS.2/TSR/SSR/SWR levels.
> **Tradeoff:** concise stakeholder wording improves clarity and traceability boundaries, but can feel under-specified unless downstream requirements are complete and linked.
> **Alternative:** embed detailed technical constraints directly in STK-005, which may feel more concrete early but blurs lifecycle layering and increases requirement duplication risk.
<!-- HITL-LOCK END:COMMENT-BLOCK-19 -->

---

### STK-006: Steering Control Function

- **Priority**: Must
- **Source**: SH-04, SH-03
- **Status**: draft

The platform shall provide a steering control function that translates steering commands into proportional steering servo angle. The system shall provide position feedback, rate limiting, and angle limiting. On detection of a steering fault, the system shall return the steering to the center position in a controlled manner.

<!-- HITL-LOCK START:COMMENT-BLOCK-20 -->
> **Why:** even on development/hobby-grade boards and actuators, steering feedback is still meaningful for demonstrating closed-loop safety logic (command-vs-feedback checks, fault detection, and safe return-to-center behavior).
> **Tradeoff:** prototype hardware has higher noise/backlash/variance than automotive-grade hardware, so results are valid for architecture and control-safety behavior but not for production-accuracy claims.
> **Alternative:** skip feedback and use open-loop steering control, which simplifies implementation but removes key safety evidence for mismatch detection and fail-safe steering behavior.
<!-- HITL-LOCK END:COMMENT-BLOCK-20 -->

---

### STK-007: Braking Control Function

- **Priority**: Must
- **Source**: SH-04, SH-03

The system shall detect lidar sensor faults and substitute a safe default (obstacle assumed present).

---

### STK-009: Independent Safety Monitoring Function

- **Priority**: Must
- **Source**: SH-04, SH-05, SH-01
- **Status**: draft

The platform shall include an independent safety monitoring function, implemented on a separate ECU from the zone controllers, that monitors all zone ECU heartbeats, performs cross-plausibility checks on safety-critical signals, and controls a hardware kill relay to force the system into a safe state when a safety violation is detected. The monitoring ECU shall operate in CAN listen-only mode.

---

### STK-010: Emergency Stop Function

- **Priority**: Must
- **Source**: SH-04, SH-03
- **Status**: draft

The platform shall provide a hardware emergency stop button that, when activated, immediately commands all actuators to their safe state (motor off, brakes applied, steering centered) and latches the system in a safe stop condition until a manual restart is performed.

---

### STK-011: Body Control Function

- **Priority**: Should
- **Source**: SH-01, SH-04
- **Status**: draft

The platform shall provide body control functions including automatic headlight activation based on driving state, turn indicator control, and hazard light activation during fault or emergency conditions.

### STK-013: Diagnostic Trouble Code Management

- **Priority**: Must
- **Source**: SH-06, SH-01
- **Status**: draft

The platform shall store diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) with associated freeze-frame data for all detected faults. DTCs shall be persistent across power cycles (stored in non-volatile memory). The system shall support reading, clearing, and aging of DTCs per standard diagnostic conventions.

### STK-014: Cloud Telemetry and Dashboarding

- **Priority**: Should
- **Source**: SH-01, SH-03
- **Status**: draft

---

### STK-015: Edge ML Anomaly Detection

- **Priority**: Should
- **Source**: SH-01, SH-03
- **Status**: draft

The platform shall include an edge machine learning inference capability that detects anomalous patterns in motor current, temperature, and CAN bus traffic. Anomaly alerts shall be forwarded to the cloud dashboard and shall not be used for safety-critical decisions.

---

Each safe state shall be achievable within the defined Fault Tolerant Time Interval.

---

### STK-018: Fault Tolerant Time Interval Compliance

- **Priority**: Must
- **Source**: SH-05, SH-01
- **Status**: draft

The platform shall detect safety-relevant faults and achieve the corresponding safe state within the Fault Tolerant Time Interval defined for each safety goal. The FTTI budget shall account for detection time, reaction time, actuation time, and a safety margin. FTTI values shall be justified by physical analysis of the hazard progression.

---

### STK-019: Independent Safety Monitoring with Kill Relay

- **Priority**: Must
- **Source**: SH-05, SH-01, SH-04
- **Status**: draft

The platform shall include a hardware-enforced safety boundary (kill relay) controlled by the independent Safety Controller. The relay shall use an energize-to-run configuration such that any failure of the Safety Controller inherently results in power removal from all safety-critical actuators. The kill relay shall be the ultimate safety enforcement mechanism, independent of the zone controller software.

---

### STK-020: E2E Protection on Safety-Critical CAN Messages

- **Priority**: Must
- **Source**: SH-05, SH-03
- **Status**: draft

All safety-critical CAN messages shall be protected with end-to-end (E2E) data protection including CRC, alive counter, and data identification. The E2E mechanism shall detect message corruption, repetition, loss, delay, insertion, and masquerading. On E2E verification failure, the receiver shall substitute safe default values.

- **Status**: draft

The CAN bus shall operate at 500 kbps and shall support the transmission of all defined messages within their specified cycle times. The bus utilization shall not exceed 60% under normal operation to provide margin for burst traffic and retransmissions. All safety-critical messages shall have CAN IDs assigned by priority (lower ID = higher priority = safety-critical).

---

### STK-023: Sensor Update Rates

Each scenario shall be triggerable and observable without requiring code changes.

---

### STK-026: Visual and Audible Operator Feedback

- **Priority**: Must
- **Source**: SH-04, SH-03
- **Status**: draft

The platform shall provide operator feedback through at least three independent channels: a display showing current operating state and fault information, an audible warning device with distinct patterns for different severity levels, and fault indicator LEDs that are independent of the CAN bus. At least one feedback channel shall remain operational even during total CAN bus failure.

---

### STK-027: Reproducible Build and Demo Process

- **Priority**: Should

All firmware source code shall comply with MISRA C:2012 (with Amendment 2 / 2023 updates) as required by ISO 26262-6 for ASIL D software. Deviations from mandatory MISRA rules shall follow a formal deviation process including justification, risk assessment, and approval. Static analysis shall enforce MISRA compliance as part of the build process.

---

### STK-031: Bidirectional Traceability

- **Priority**: Must
- **Source**: SH-05, SH-01
- **Status**: draft

The platform shall maintain bidirectional traceability across the full V-model: stakeholder requirements to system requirements, system requirements to architecture elements, architecture to software requirements, software requirements to source code and unit tests, and up through integration and system verification.

### 6.2 Downstream Traceability (STK to SYS)

Bidirectional traceability from stakeholder requirements to system requirements is maintained in the System Requirements Specification (SYSREQ) and summarized in the traceability matrix at the end of that document.

## 7. Open Items

| ID | Item | Owner | Target |
|----|------|-------|--------|
| STK-O-001 | Validate all STK requirements with full system requirements derivation (SYS.2) | System Engineer | SYS.2 phase |
| STK-O-002 | Review STK-025 demo scenario list against master plan scenario definitions | Project Manager | Before SYS.2 |
| STK-O-003 | Confirm STK-032 SAP QM scope with project stakeholders | Project Manager | Phase 0 |

## Review Findings (2026-02-23)

- `RECOMMENDED (NOT DONE)` [Severity: HIGH] Open-item schedule status is stale relative to current phase history.
  - Finding: `STK-O-003` target is `Phase 0` but remains open in the stakeholder document.
  - Meaningful metric: 1 of 3 stakeholder open items has a missed target phase with no disposition update.
  - Why it matters: stale open-item targets reduce governance credibility and make phase-readiness tracking ambiguous.
  - Target path: `taktflow-embedded/docs/aspice/system/stakeholder-requirements.md`.
  - Completion signal: item is either closed with evidence or re-planned with new owner/date and rationale.

- `RECOMMENDED (NOT DONE)` [Severity: MEDIUM] Section numbering is internally inconsistent.
  - Finding: document moves from `## 10. Regulatory and Standards Requirements` back to `## 6. Traceability`, then `## 7` and `## 8`.
  - Meaningful metric: at least 3 top-level sections are out of numeric order.
  - Why it matters: numbering drift creates review friction and weakens document control quality for assessments.
  - Target path: `taktflow-embedded/docs/aspice/system/stakeholder-requirements.md`.
  - Completion signal: top-level headings are renumbered (or converted to unnumbered style) with monotonic order.

- `RECOMMENDED (NOT DONE)` [Severity: MEDIUM] Stakeholder-to-system derivation wording conflicts with known process-scope requirement.
  - Finding: `STK-O-001` says "Validate all STK requirements with full system requirements derivation", while STK-027 is explicitly handled as process scope in SYSREQ mapping.
  - Meaningful metric: derivation rule currently implies 32/32 SYS derivation, but agreed mapping behavior is 31 direct + 1 process-scope.
  - Why it matters: contradictory derivation rules can produce repeated audit discussions about "missing" SYS children.
  - Target path: `taktflow-embedded/docs/aspice/system/stakeholder-requirements.md` and `taktflow-embedded/docs/aspice/system/system-requirements.md`.
  - Completion signal: derivation rule explicitly allows documented process-scope exceptions (with trace record).

- `RECOMMENDED (NOT DONE)` [Severity: MEDIUM] Several STK clauses include solution/verification constraints that may be over-specific for SYS.1.
  - Finding: examples include explicit MC/DC/formal-method language in STK-016 and specific UDS service IDs in STK-012.
  - Meaningful metric: at least 2 stakeholder requirements embed detailed implementation/verification constraints.
  - Why it matters: overly detailed SYS.1 statements can reduce flexibility and blur separation between stakeholder intent and SYS.2/SWE requirements.
  - Target path: `taktflow-embedded/docs/aspice/system/stakeholder-requirements.md`.
  - Completion signal: requirement wording clearly distinguishes stakeholder intent vs downstream technical allocation constraints.

<!-- HITL-LOCK START:COMMENT-BLOCK-14 -->
> **Why:** cleaning governance and derivation language at SYS.1 prevents repeated traceability disputes in later SYS.2/SWE reviews.
> **Tradeoff:** tightening requirement boundaries now takes editing effort, but lowers future rework and audit ambiguity.
> **Alternative:** leave SYS.1 as-is and resolve conflicts downstream, which is faster short-term but increases lifecycle drift risk.
<!-- HITL-LOCK END:COMMENT-BLOCK-14 -->

## Document Architecture Fit Assessment (2026-02-23)

- Purpose-fit verdict: `FIT FOR SYS.1 INTENT CAPTURE (PARTIAL FOR STRICT SYS.1 BOUNDARY)`.
- Scope fit:
  - Strong: stakeholder context, requirement inventory, and portfolio/audit narrative are clearly represented.
  - Partial: some requirements include downstream technical/verification constraints that are typically SYS.2/SWE-level allocations.
- Structural strengths:
  - Clear requirement taxonomy (portfolio, functional, safety, performance, usability, regulatory).
  - Stable requirement ID convention (`STK-001..032`) and source mapping.
  - Explicit traceability intent toward SYS requirements.
- Structural gaps:
  - Top-level section numbering is non-monotonic after section 10.
  - Open-item governance timing is stale for at least one target phase.
  - Derivation wording implies full STK-to-SYS derivation despite documented process-scope exception.
- Usage recommendation:
  - Keep this document as the stakeholder-intent baseline.
  - Move implementation/verification specificity to SYS.2/SWE artifacts and keep SYS.1 wording outcome-oriented.

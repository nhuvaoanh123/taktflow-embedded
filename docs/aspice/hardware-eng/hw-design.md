## Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Comment Lock

`HITL` means human-reviewer-owned comment content.

**Marker standard (code-friendly):**
- Markdown: `<!-- HITL-LOCK START:<id> -->` ... `<!-- HITL-LOCK END:<id> -->`
- C/C++/Java/JS/TS: `// HITL-LOCK START:<id>` ... `// HITL-LOCK END:<id>`
- Python/Shell/YAML/TOML: `# HITL-LOCK START:<id>` ... `# HITL-LOCK END:<id>`

**Rules:**
- AI must never edit, reformat, move, or delete text inside any `HITL-LOCK` block.
- Append-only: AI may add new comments/changes only; prior HITL comments stay unchanged.
- If a locked comment needs revision, add a new note outside the lock or ask the human reviewer to unlock it.


# Hardware Design

## 1. Purpose

This document describes the hardware design for the Taktflow Zonal Vehicle Platform per Automotive SPICE 4.0 HWE.2 (Hardware Design). It provides system-level and per-ECU circuit descriptions, power distribution design, bus topology, grounding strategy, and key circuit schematics in ASCII form. This document translates the hardware requirements (HWR) and hardware safety requirements (HSR) into concrete circuit designs.

                       3.3V  3.3V

  Pull-ups: 4.7k ohm on SCL and SDA to 3.3V (external).
  10uF bulk capacitor for display inrush current.
  I2C speed: 400 kHz (Fast Mode).
  Address: 0x3C (7-bit), fixed on SSD1306 module.
```

#### 5.1.4 E-Stop Button Circuit

```
  3.3V (internal pull-up on PC13, ~40k)
    |
    +--- PC13 (EXTI, rising-edge) ---[10k series R]---+--- [100nF] --- GND
    |                                                  |    (RC debounce)
    |                                              [TVS 3.3V]
    |                                                  |
    +--- [NC Push Button] --- GND                     GND

  Resting state: button closed -> PC13 = LOW (connected to GND through button)
  Button pressed: button opens -> PC13 = HIGH (pulled up by internal pull-up)
  Broken wire: PC13 = HIGH (E-stop activated) -- FAIL-SAFE

  Rising edge triggers EXTI interrupt.
  RC debounce: tau = 10k * 100nF = 1 ms.
  TVS diode protects PC13 from static on button wiring.
```

#### 5.1.5 CVC Watchdog Circuit

```
                    TPS3823DBVR
                    +-----------+
  3.3V --[100nF]--->| VDD    MR |--- 3.3V (MR tied high = no manual reset)

                    |           |         |
                    | CT    GND |       (push-pull, active-low)
                    +---+-------+
                        |
                     [100nF] (sets timeout = 1.6 sec)
                        |
                       GND

  Firmware toggles PB0 at regular intervals (conditioned on self-checks).
  If PB0 stops toggling for 1.6 sec, TPS3823 pulls RESET low -> MCU resets.
  TPS3823 internal oscillator is independent of STM32 clock.
```

#### 5.1.6 CVC Power Supply Design

```
  12V Main Rail
       |
  [Nucleo Vin pin] ---> Nucleo onboard LDO (LD39050) ---> 3.3V (MCU power)
       |
       +--- 5V (Nucleo onboard USB regulator, if USB connected)

  External 3.3V rail ---> SPI sensors (AS5048A x2)
                     ---> CAN transceiver (TJA1051T/3)
                     ---> TPS3823 watchdog
                     ---> I2C OLED (SSD1306)
                     ---> Status LEDs

  Power domains are separated:
  - MCU powered from Nucleo onboard LDO (independent of external 3.3V rail)
  - Peripherals powered from external 3.3V rail
  - No connection between MCU 3.3V and external 3.3V (separate ground paths merge at star ground point)

  ALTERNATIVELY: SC powered via LaunchPad USB (5V USB -> onboard 3.3V LDO).
  The LaunchPad includes an onboard XDS110 debug probe with USB power.
  For bench operation, USB power is the simplest approach.

  CRITICAL: SC power is independent of the kill relay.
  When kill relay opens, SC remains powered to:
    - Log DTCs
    - Maintain fault LED indication
    - Continue watchdog feed (if firmware is healthy)

## 6. CAN Bus Design

### 6.1 Bus Topology

  term.                                                 term.

  Bus stubs: < 100 mm from main trunk to each ECU transceiver
  Total bus length: ~300 mm main trunk + stubs = ~700 mm total
  (well within 2 m maximum specified in HWR-014)

  Additional taps (T-connection, < 100 mm stub):
  - CANable 2.0 #1: connected to Raspberry Pi 4 (USB)
  - CANable 2.0 #2: connected to development PC (USB) for CAN analyzer
```

### 6.2 CAN Connector Plan

Each ECU connects to the CAN bus via a screw terminal block:

| Terminal | Signal | Wire Color |
|----------|--------|------------|
| 1 | CAN_H | Yellow |
| 2 | CAN_L | Green |
| 3 | GND (CAN reference) | Black |

The CAN bus uses a daisy-chain wiring pattern: the main trunk wire runs along the base plate edge, with 3-position screw terminal blocks at each ECU location. The trunk wire is continuous (not broken at each terminal block -- wire-in, wire-out through the same terminal).

### 6.3 Bit Timing Configuration

| Parameter | STM32G474RE (FDCAN) | TMS570LC43x (DCAN) |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Input clock | 170 MHz (PCLK1) | 75 MHz (VCLK1, after PLL) |
| Prescaler | 34 | 15 |
| Nominal bit rate clock | 5 MHz | 5 MHz |
| Time quanta per bit | 10 | 10 |
| TSEG1 | 7 tq | 7 tq |
| TSEG2 | 2 tq | 2 tq |
| SJW | 2 tq | 2 tq |
| Sample point | 80% | 80% |
| Actual bit rate | 500.000 kbps | 500.000 kbps |

Both controllers use the same number of time quanta and sample point to ensure identical bit timing on the bus.

### 8.2 Ground Plane and Separation Rules

1. **Star ground**: All ground returns converge at a single star ground point (screw terminal or bus bar). This prevents ground loops and ensures all ECUs share the same ground reference.

2. **Analog/digital ground separation**: On each ECU's protoboard, the analog ground (ADC reference, sensor returns) and digital ground (MCU, CAN transceiver) shall be separated by at least 5 mm and connected at a single point near the MCU's VSS/VSSA pins.

3. **ACS723 ground reference**: The ACS723 analog output ground (GND pin) shall be connected directly to the RZC's analog ground, with a short, low-impedance trace. The ACS723 power path ground (IP- pin) connects to the motor power ground, which is a separate high-current path.

4. **Motor power ground**: The motor power return (from BTS7960 B- to PSU GND) shall use 16 AWG wire and connect directly to the star ground point. This high-current path shall not pass through any signal ground connections.

5. **CAN bus ground**: A CAN reference ground wire (CAN_GND) shall run alongside the CAN_H/CAN_L twisted pair. This provides a common-mode reference for all CAN transceivers. CAN_GND connects to the star ground point.

6. **Decoupling ground returns**: All decoupling capacitor grounds shall connect to the local ground plane/wire within 5 mm of the capacitor.

## 9. Design Decisions

### 9.1 Key Design References

| Decision | ADR Reference | Rationale |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| Zonal architecture (4-ECU physical) | ADR-001 | Modern E/E pattern, fewer ECUs, more resume impact |
| STM32G474RE for zone controllers | ADR-002 | Cortex-M4F, FDCAN, sufficient pins, good tooling |
| TMS570LC43x for safety controller | ADR-003 | Lockstep Cortex-R5F, TUV-certified safety manual |
| Energize-to-run kill relay pattern | ADR-003 | Gold standard for safety-critical power cutoff |
| TJA1051T/3 for STM32 CAN transceivers | ADR-004 | 3.3V native, CAN FD capable, ISO 11898-2 |
| SN65HVD230 for TMS570 CAN transceiver | ADR-004 | TI vendor consistency, 3.3V, proven with DCAN |
| DCAN1 (not DCAN4) for TMS570 | ADR-005 | HALCoGen v04.07.01 mailbox bug on DCAN4 |
| TPS3823 external watchdog | ADR-006 | Independent oscillator, push-pull reset, SOT-23-5 |
| AS5048A magnetic angle sensors | ADR-007 | 14-bit, SPI, 10 MHz max, contactless |
| BTS7960 H-bridge module | ADR-008 | 43A rated, 3.3V logic, built-in current sense |

### 9.2 Design Trade-offs

| Trade-off | Chosen | Alternative | Why Chosen |
|-----------|--------|-------------|------------|
| CAN transceiver for STM32 | TJA1051T/3 (NXP, 3.3V) | MCP2551 (Microchip, 5V) | 3.3V native eliminates level shifter |
| Motor current sensor | ACS723 (Hall) + BTS7960 IS (built-in) | Shunt resistor + INA219 | Galvanic isolation, simpler circuit |
| Servo voltage | 6V regulated from 12V act. rail | Direct 5V from 5V rail | Higher torque at 6V, separate from logic power |
| E-stop wiring | NC button (fail-safe) | NO button (simpler) | Wire break = E-stop activated (fail-safe) |
| MCU power | Nucleo onboard LDO | External 3.3V regulator | Simplicity, Nucleo is a dev board with built-in regulation |

## 10. Assembly Notes

### 10.1 Assembly Order

1. Mount all Nucleo and LaunchPad boards on the base plate with standoffs.
2. Install the kill relay, E-stop button, and fault LED panel.
3. Wire the 12V main rail (16 AWG) from PSU entry point to distribution terminals.
4. Install and wire the 5V and 3.3V buck converter modules.
5. Wire the kill relay circuit (MOSFET, flyback diode, gate resistor, pulldown).
6. Wire the CAN bus trunk (twisted pair) along the base plate edge with 120 ohm terminators.
7. Connect CAN transceivers to each ECU and to the bus trunk via screw terminals.
8. Wire sensor interfaces (SPI, UART, ADC) with color-coded cables.
9. Wire actuator interfaces (PWM servos, BTS7960 motor driver).
10. Install watchdog ICs and connect WDI/RESET lines to each MCU.
11. Install protection components (TVS diodes, Zener clamps, fuses).
12. Connect the Raspberry Pi and CANable 2.0 to the CAN bus.
13. Perform continuity check on all connections before applying power.

### 10.2 First Power-Up Checklist

1. Verify 12V main rail voltage at each ECU (expected: 11.5-12.5V after Schottky drop).
2. Verify 5V rail voltage (expected: 4.9-5.1V).
3. Verify 3.3V rail voltage (expected: 3.2-3.4V).
4. Verify kill relay is OPEN (no 12V on actuator rail) before SC firmware runs.
5. Verify each Nucleo board boots via USB (LED blinks).
6. Verify LaunchPad boots via USB (XDS110 LED).
7. Verify CAN bus termination resistance (60 ohm between CAN_H and CAN_L, all nodes off).
8. Verify E-stop button: pressing button causes PC13 to go HIGH.
9. Verify TPS3823 power-on reset pulse on each MCU NRST pin (oscilloscope).
10. Verify kill relay closes when SC drives GIO_A0 HIGH (12V appears on actuator rail).

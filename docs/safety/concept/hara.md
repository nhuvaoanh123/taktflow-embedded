# Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment

<!-- DECISION: ADR-002 — HARA scope: ratings assume real vehicle operation per A-001 -->

## 1. Purpose

This document identifies hazardous events arising from malfunctions of the Taktflow Zonal Vehicle Platform, assesses the associated risk according to ISO 26262-3 Clause 7, and determines the Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL) for each hazardous event. The HARA serves as the foundation for deriving safety goals (ISO 26262-3 Clause 8) and the functional safety concept (ISO 26262-3 Clause 9).

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 Item Under Analysis

The item is the Taktflow Zonal Vehicle Platform as defined in the Item Definition (document ID: ITEM-DEF). The item comprises 7 ECU nodes (4 physical, 3 simulated), sensors, actuators, safety hardware, and CAN bus communication infrastructure. The item provides the following vehicle-level functions:

| Function ID | Function Name | Description | ECUs Involved |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| F-DBW | Drive-by-Wire | Pedal input to motor torque control | CVC, RZC |
| F-STR | Steering Control | Steering command to servo angle | CVC, FZC |
| F-BRK | Braking Control | Brake command to servo force, emergency braking | CVC, FZC |
| F-DIST | Distance Sensing | Lidar obstacle detection and response | FZC |
| F-SAF | Safety Monitoring | Independent heartbeat, plausibility, kill relay | SC |
| F-BODY | Body Control | Headlights, indicators, door locks | BCM |
| F-DIAG | Diagnostics | UDS, DTCs, dashboard display, telemetry | ICU, TCU |

### 2.2 Assumption on Operational Context

Per assumption A-001 in the Item Definition, all Severity (S), Exposure (E), and Controllability (C) ratings assume the platform controls a real vehicle in real traffic scenarios. This is intentional to demonstrate full competence with the ISO 26262 HARA process and to derive meaningful ASIL levels. The platform is physically an indoor bench demo; the elevated ratings are a standard practice in academic and portfolio HARA work.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Process

The HARA follows the process prescribed in ISO 26262-3 Clause 7:

1. **Situation Analysis**: Define operational situations covering the vehicle's usage profile.
2. **Hazard Identification**: Systematically identify malfunctioning behaviors for each item-level function and determine the resulting hazardous events.
3. **Risk Assessment**: For each hazardous event, independently assess Severity (S), Exposure (E), and Controllability (C).
4. **ASIL Determination**: Determine the ASIL using the ISO 26262-3 Table 4 matrix.

### 3.2 Participants

The HARA was conducted in a cross-functional workshop format per ISO 26262-3, 7.4.1.1.

## 4. Operational Situations

The following operational situations represent the driving/usage scenarios under which the vehicle platform could be operating. These are used to contextualize each hazardous event.

### OS-1: Driving Forward at Moderate Speed

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Speed | 30-80 km/h |
| Direction | Forward |
| Road type | Urban or suburban road, mixed traffic |
| Driver attention | Normal (eyes on road, hands on wheel) |
| Environment | Dry or wet road surface, daylight or artificial lighting |
| Traffic density | Medium (other vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists nearby) |

**Rationale**: This is the most common driving scenario and represents the highest exposure to hazards from drive-by-wire, steering, and braking malfunctions.

### OS-2: Stationary (Vehicle at Rest)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Speed | 0 km/h |
| Direction | None |
| Road type | Parking lot, roadside, intersection stop |
| Driver attention | Variable (may be distracted — phone, passengers) |
| Environment | Any surface, any lighting condition |
| Traffic density | Variable (parked or stopped in traffic) |

**Rationale**: While the vehicle is not moving, unintended acceleration or steering movement can cause harm to nearby pedestrians, other vehicles, or the occupants themselves.

### OS-3: Turning at Low Speed

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Speed | 5-30 km/h |
| Direction | Turning left or right |
| Road type | Intersection, curve, roundabout |
| Driver attention | High (actively steering, checking mirrors/blind spots) |
| Environment | Mixed traffic, potential pedestrians in crosswalk |
| Traffic density | Medium to high |

**Rationale**: Turning requires active steering control. Loss of steering or unintended steering movement during a turn presents severe risk of leaving the lane or striking obstacles/pedestrians in the turning path.

### OS-4: Braking (Active Deceleration)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Speed | 10-80 km/h, decelerating |
| Direction | Forward |
| Road type | Any — approaching stop sign, traffic light, obstacle, vehicle ahead |
| Driver attention | High (actively braking, focused on stopping distance) |
| Environment | Any surface condition (dry, wet, gravel) |
| Traffic density | Variable |

**Rationale**: Loss of braking during active deceleration directly affects the ability to stop before an obstacle or intersection, with potentially fatal consequences.

### OS-5: Reversing at Low Speed

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Speed | 0-10 km/h |
| Direction | Reverse |
| Road type | Parking lot, driveway, garage |
| Driver attention | Divided (looking backward, using mirrors, limited visibility) |
| Environment | Confined spaces, potential pedestrians behind vehicle |
| Traffic density | Low but pedestrians may be close |

**Rationale**: Reversing involves limited visibility. Unintended acceleration in reverse or motor direction errors can strike pedestrians or objects behind the vehicle.

### OS-6: Diagnostic Mode (Service/Maintenance)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Speed | 0 km/h (vehicle stationary, ignition on) |
| Direction | None |
| Road type | Service bay, workshop |
| Driver attention | Technician focused on diagnostic tool, not on vehicle motion |
| Environment | Indoor service environment, people may be near vehicle |
| Traffic density | None (controlled environment) |

**Rationale**: During diagnostic sessions, unexpected vehicle motion (motor activation, servo movement) poses risk to service technicians who are not expecting motion. The vehicle is assumed to be on a lift or with wheels blocked, reducing but not eliminating risk.

### OS-7: Driving Forward at High Speed

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Speed | 80-130 km/h |
| Direction | Forward |
| Road type | Highway, expressway |
| Driver attention | Normal to low (highway monotony, possible fatigue) |
| Environment | Multi-lane, high closing speeds, barriers |
| Traffic density | Variable (free-flow to dense) |

**Rationale**: High-speed driving amplifies the severity of any loss-of-control event. Unintended acceleration, steering deviation, or braking failure at highway speeds is more likely to result in life-threatening outcomes.

## 7. S/E/C Rating Justifications

### 7.1 HE-001: Unintended Acceleration During Driving

**Severity S3**: Unintended acceleration into traffic or obstacles at moderate speed (30-80 km/h) can result in high-energy collisions with other vehicles, pedestrians, or fixed objects. The kinetic energy involved is sufficient to cause life-threatening or fatal injuries to occupants and third parties. Real-world unintended acceleration events (e.g., Toyota 2009-2010) have caused fatalities.

**Exposure E4**: Driving forward at moderate speed is the most common operational state of a vehicle. Virtually every trip involves sustained forward driving. Per ISO 26262-3 Table B.2, this represents high probability (> 10% of operating time). The dual pedal sensors are continuously active during all forward driving.

**Controllability C3**: If both pedal sensors simultaneously report a high value, the vehicle accelerates without any driver input on the pedal. The driver has no immediate intuitive response to counteract this — releasing the pedal has no effect because the sensors are reporting a false high regardless of pedal position. The driver must recognize the situation, identify that the accelerator is not the cause, and apply brakes or use the E-stop, all while the vehicle is accelerating. This requires an atypical response and significant reaction time, making it difficult to control for most drivers.

### 7.2 HE-002: Loss of Drive Torque During Driving

**Severity S2**: Sudden loss of motive power during moderate-speed driving causes the vehicle to decelerate unexpectedly. While the vehicle does not actively endanger its occupants (it is slowing down), following vehicles may collide with the decelerating vehicle. This can result in severe injuries but survival is probable, especially in moderate-speed urban scenarios.

**Exposure E4**: Forward driving is the dominant operating condition. The motor torque function is active continuously during all forward driving.

**Controllability C2**: The driver experiences a sudden loss of acceleration. The vehicle slows down but does not lose steering or braking. The driver can steer to the roadside, apply hazard lights, and brake to a controlled stop. This is an unusual but manageable situation for a normally attentive driver.

### 7.3 HE-003: Unintended Steering During Driving

**Severity S3**: Unintended steering deviation at moderate speed (30-80 km/h) can cause the vehicle to cross into oncoming traffic lanes or leave the roadway. Head-on collisions or rollover events at these speeds are life-threatening or fatal.

**Exposure E3**: Unintended steering requires a specific malfunction condition (CAN corruption, software fault) to coincide with active driving. The steering function is always active during driving, but the specific malfunction that causes unintended movement (rather than loss of steering) is a medium-probability event. The CAN message carrying the steering command is transmitted every 10 ms, meaning a corruption event has many opportunities to occur, but the E2E protection reduces the probability somewhat.

**Controllability C3**: A sudden unexpected steering deviation at moderate speed gives the driver very little time to react. At 50 km/h, the vehicle is traveling at approximately 14 m/s. A steering deviation that moves the vehicle one lane width (3.5 m) in less than 0.25 seconds gives insufficient time for most drivers to correct. The corrective action (counter-steer) is instinctive but may be insufficient if the servo is actively fighting the driver's input.

### 7.4 HE-004: Loss of Steering During Turning

**Severity S3**: Loss of steering response during an active turn means the vehicle will travel straight (or in a widening arc) instead of following the intended path. At intersections, this can result in collision with crossing traffic, pedestrians in crosswalks, or roadside infrastructure. The geometry of intersections means even low-speed failures can direct the vehicle into high-severity collision scenarios (e.g., T-bone collision with crossing traffic).

**Exposure E4**: Turning is a frequent driving maneuver. Urban driving involves numerous turns at intersections, roundabouts, and parking lots. Per ISO 26262-3 Table B.2, the frequency of turning maneuvers during normal driving exceeds the threshold for high exposure.

**Controllability C3**: Once steering response is lost during a turn, the driver cannot redirect the vehicle. Braking is the only available response, but the vehicle's trajectory is already committed to a straight line through the turn. At intersection speeds (15-30 km/h), the time between loss of steering and collision with crossing traffic or pedestrians may be 1-2 seconds, which is insufficient for most drivers to stop completely. The driver must recognize the loss of steering, switch from steering correction to braking, and stop before the collision — a complex multi-step response under time pressure.

### 7.5 HE-005: Loss of Braking During Braking

**Severity S3**: Loss of braking when the driver is actively decelerating means the vehicle will not stop as expected. This leads to collision with the obstacle, vehicle, or intersection that the driver was braking for. At moderate speeds, this is a life-threatening scenario (e.g., failure to stop at a red light, failure to stop for a pedestrian crossing).

**Exposure E4**: Braking is a continuous and frequent activity during all driving. Urban driving involves braking for every intersection, traffic light, and traffic situation. The braking function is invoked dozens of times per trip.

**Controllability C3**: If the brake servo does not apply force when commanded, the driver has no alternative braking mechanism in this drive-by-wire system (no mechanical fallback brake in the platform design). The driver can attempt engine braking by releasing the accelerator, or use the E-stop, but these responses are atypical and require the driver to recognize the brake failure, shift strategy, and act — all while the vehicle is approaching the obstacle. For most drivers, the instinctive response is to press the brake pedal harder, which has no effect.

### 7.6 HE-006: Unintended Braking During Driving

**Severity S2**: Unexpected braking during forward driving causes sudden deceleration. Occupants experience a jolt but are restrained by seatbelts. The primary risk is from following vehicles that may rear-end the suddenly decelerating vehicle. At moderate speeds, rear-end collisions typically result in severe injuries but survival is probable (whiplash, airbag deployment).

**Exposure E3**: The malfunction requires a CAN message corruption or software error specifically affecting the brake command during driving. While the brake function receives commands continuously, the specific condition causing unintended activation is a medium-probability event.

**Controllability C2**: The driver feels unexpected deceleration and can release the brake (though the brake is applied by software, not the driver's foot). The driver can signal intent via hazard lights and steer to the roadside. Following drivers have some reaction time (brake lights illuminate). The situation is unusual but manageable for a normally attentive driver.

### 7.7 HE-007: Motor Overcurrent Not Detected During Driving

**Severity S2**: Undetected overcurrent causes progressive motor heating. In the short term (seconds to minutes), this does not directly affect vehicle motion. Over sustained periods, it can lead to motor winding insulation failure, smoke, or fire within the motor housing. Thermal events in the vehicle powertrain are severe (survival probable) but rarely immediately fatal.

**Exposure E3**: Overcurrent conditions require a specific load condition (mechanical blockage, short circuit, overload) combined with sensor failure. The current sensor is continuously monitoring, so the exposure is tied to the probability of the sensor failing coincidentally with a high-current condition.

**Controllability C2**: The driver may notice unusual smells (hot insulation), reduced motor performance, or warning signs of overheating. The driver can stop the vehicle voluntarily. The progression from overcurrent to thermal hazard is gradual (tens of seconds to minutes), giving the driver time to react.

### 7.8 HE-008: Motor Overtemperature Not Detected

**Severity S2**: Similar to overcurrent, undetected overtemperature can lead to motor degradation, smoke, or fire. The thermal mass of the motor means temperature rises gradually over minutes, not seconds.

**Exposure E2**: Overtemperature requires sustained high-load operation (e.g., hill climbing, towing) combined with temperature sensor failure. The scenario is a coincidence of two conditions, making it low probability during normal driving.

**Controllability C2**: The driver has minutes of warning before a thermal event becomes dangerous. Reduced motor performance and unusual sounds/smells provide additional cues. The driver can stop the vehicle voluntarily.

### 7.9 HE-009: Lidar False Negative (Obstacle Not Detected) During Driving

**Severity S3**: If the lidar fails to detect an obstacle in the vehicle's path, the autonomous emergency braking function does not activate. The vehicle collides with the obstacle at driving speed. At moderate speeds (30-80 km/h), collision with a pedestrian or vehicle is life-threatening or fatal.

**Exposure E3**: The lidar is one layer of obstacle detection. A false negative requires a specific combination of conditions: obstacle present in the driving path, lidar failing to detect it (lens contamination, reflectivity issue, UART error), AND the driver not independently braking. This combined probability is medium.

**Controllability C3**: The driver is assumed to be relying on the lidar-based emergency braking as a safety net. If the lidar fails silently, the driver does not receive an expected warning and may not react in time. The driver's own observation of the obstacle depends on attention, visibility, and reaction time. For scenarios where the driver is inattentive or visibility is poor, the obstacle may be uncontrollable.

### 7.10 HE-010: Lidar False Positive (Phantom Braking) During Driving

**Severity S2**: Phantom braking causes unexpected deceleration similar to HE-006. The primary risk is from following vehicles. The braking is limited to the emergency brake force level, which is a strong but survivable deceleration.

**Exposure E3**: False positive events depend on environmental conditions (reflective surfaces, rain, dust). They are not constant but occur in specific scenarios.

**Controllability C2**: The driver can override the phantom brake by pressing the accelerator (if the system allows driver override) or by waiting for the false detection to clear. Following drivers have some reaction time from brake light activation. The situation is controllable with normal driver attention.

### 7.11 HE-011: CAN Bus Total Failure During Driving

**Severity S3**: Total CAN bus failure means all inter-ECU communication ceases simultaneously. The CVC can no longer send torque, steering, or brake commands. The RZC, FZC, and SC receive no updates. Depending on the failure mode of each ECU upon communication loss, the vehicle may continue at the last commanded speed/angle (stuck-at-last-value) or enter an uncoordinated state. The unpredictability of vehicle behavior during total communication loss is life-threatening.

**Exposure E3**: Total CAN bus failure requires a catastrophic event: bus wire break, both termination resistors failing, or a dominant transceiver fault. These are uncommon but not incredible events, especially considering vibration, connector quality, and environmental exposure over vehicle lifetime.

**Controllability C3**: When all communication fails simultaneously, the vehicle behavior becomes unpredictable. The driver may lose steering, braking, and throttle control simultaneously. The driver has no single corrective action that can restore control. The E-stop may work (hardwired to CVC GPIO) but requires recognition of the total failure and physical activation of the E-stop, which is a non-standard response.

### 7.12 HE-012: Safety Controller Failure During Driving

**Severity S3**: If the Safety Controller (SC) hangs or fails, the independent safety monitoring layer is lost. Subsequent faults in zone controllers (CVC, FZC, RZC) will not be detected by the SC, and the kill relay will not be opened. This is a latent fault — no immediate hazard, but the safety net is removed, meaning the next fault in the system goes unmitigated. The severity is rated S3 because the consequence of the unmitigated subsequent fault could be life-threatening.

**Exposure E2**: The TMS570LC43x has lockstep cores and external watchdog (TPS3823). Both must fail simultaneously for the SC to hang undetected. The probability of this dual failure is low. The lockstep CPU detects approximately 99% of CPU faults, and the external watchdog detects software hangs within its timeout period.

**Controllability C3**: If the SC fails silently, the driver has no indication that the safety monitoring layer is lost (unless the fault is reported via CAN, which requires the SC to be functional to report). The driver cannot detect or control this latent fault. The C3 rating reflects the inability of the driver to compensate for loss of an invisible safety function.

### 7.13 HE-013: E-Stop Not Functional During Emergency

**Severity S3**: If the E-stop button is pressed during an emergency but the system does not stop, the driver's last-resort safety mechanism has failed. The underlying emergency condition (which prompted the E-stop use) continues unmitigated. The severity is rated based on the underlying emergency, which is assumed to be life-threatening (since the driver chose to activate the E-stop).

**Exposure E2**: The E-stop is activated only during emergencies, which are rare events. The E-stop malfunction must coincide with an emergency requiring its use. This combined probability is low.

**Controllability C3**: The E-stop is the driver's last-resort action. If it fails, the driver has exhausted their known options for stopping the vehicle. Remaining options (turning off the power supply, disconnecting the battery) are not intuitive or immediately accessible. The driver is already in a high-stress emergency situation with degraded decision-making capacity.

### 7.14 HE-014: Unintended Motor Reversal During Driving

**Severity S3**: If the motor direction suddenly reverses while driving forward at moderate speed, the vehicle experiences a sudden negative torque. This can cause loss of traction, vehicle instability, drivetrain mechanical stress, and potentially throw occupants against restraints. At higher speeds, the deceleration from reverse torque can exceed the friction limit of the tires, causing loss of directional stability.

**Exposure E3**: Motor direction reversal requires a specific fault: H-bridge direction control logic error, GPIO pin fault, or CAN message corruption that inverts the direction bit. These are uncommon faults that require specific conditions.

**Controllability C3**: The driver experiences a sudden, unexpected deceleration or reversal of the vehicle's motion. This is a highly unusual event with no intuitive corrective action. The driver may instinctively brake, which compounds the deceleration. The driver cannot counteract the reverse torque through the pedal (the pedal position is irrelevant if the direction control is faulty).

### 7.15 HE-015: Battery Overvoltage/Undervoltage During Driving

**Severity S1**: Battery voltage excursions outside the nominal range (9-16V) cause gradual performance degradation rather than sudden loss of function. Undervoltage may cause MCU brownout resets (which trigger watchdog-based safe state). Overvoltage may stress components but does not immediately cause injury. The effects are light to moderate — reduced motor power, sensor inaccuracy, or a controlled shutdown.

**Exposure E3**: Voltage excursions on a bench power supply are uncommon but not impossible. In a real vehicle, load dump and cranking transients are medium-frequency events.

**Controllability C1**: The driver notices reduced vehicle performance and can stop the vehicle voluntarily. The voltage monitoring system on the RZC provides warnings before the voltage reaches dangerous levels. The situation is simply controllable with minimal driver action.

### 7.16 HE-016: Unintended Acceleration at High Speed

**Severity S3**: Unintended acceleration at highway speeds (80-130 km/h) is life-threatening. The vehicle may exceed safe speed for road conditions, other traffic, or road geometry. Collision energy increases with the square of velocity.

**Exposure E3**: Highway driving is common but less frequent than urban driving. The same dual sensor failure mode applies but the operational situation is less frequent than OS-1.

**Controllability C3**: Same controllability challenges as HE-001, compounded by higher speed. The driver has even less time to react and the consequences of delayed reaction are more severe.

### 7.17 HE-017: Unintended Vehicle Motion from Rest

**Severity S3**: A stationary vehicle that suddenly lurches forward at full motor power can strike pedestrians who are near the vehicle (loading cargo, crossing in front, children playing). The initial acceleration from rest is rapid and the victims have no warning. This is life-threatening, especially for vulnerable road users.

**Exposure E4**: The vehicle is stationary frequently (parking, traffic stops, loading/unloading). The motor control malfunction (BTS7960 FET short, PWM stuck at 100%) can occur at any time, including when stationary.

**Controllability C3**: Pedestrians near a stationary vehicle have no expectation of sudden vehicle motion and cannot react in time. The driver may not have hands on the steering wheel or feet near the brake pedal when stationary. The sudden motion is surprising and the driver's reaction to press the brake or E-stop requires recognition time.

### 7.18 HE-018: Unintended Forward Motion During Reversing

**Severity S2**: During reversing at low speed (0-10 km/h), if the motor direction reverses to forward, the vehicle moves forward unexpectedly. This can strike objects in front of the vehicle. At low speed (0-10 km/h), the collision energy is moderate, resulting in severe injuries but survival is probable.

**Exposure E3**: Reversing is a less common operating situation than forward driving. The direction reversal fault must coincide with the reversing maneuver.

**Controllability C2**: At low reversing speed, the driver can brake to stop the vehicle relatively quickly. The unexpected forward motion is surprising but the low speed gives the driver more time to react. The corrective action (brake) is intuitive.

### 7.19 HE-019: Motor Enable Stuck During Driving

**Severity S3**: If the motor enable signal is stuck active, the motor cannot be electrically disabled by the RZC software. Even with zero torque command, the BTS7960 may continue to drive the motor if the enable pins are stuck. The vehicle cannot decelerate through motor control. This is effectively a loss of motor controllability, similar to unintended acceleration.

**Exposure E3**: A stuck GPIO pin (BTS7960 R_EN or L_EN) is an uncommon hardware fault. It requires a specific failure mode (pin short to VCC, solder bridge, or FET gate short).

**Controllability C3**: The driver cannot control the motor through the pedal. Braking is available but the motor continues to fight the brakes. The driver must use the E-stop or rely on the Safety Controller kill relay to cut power. This is a non-standard response that most drivers would not immediately identify.

### 7.20 HE-020: CAN Bus Babbling Node During Driving

**Severity S3**: A babbling node floods the CAN bus with continuous high-priority frames, effectively blocking all other ECU communication. Safety-critical messages (heartbeats, torque commands, brake commands) cannot get through. The effect is similar to total CAN bus failure (HE-011) but caused by a software/hardware fault in a single ECU rather than a bus-level fault.

**Exposure E2**: A babbling node requires a specific software or hardware fault in one ECU (e.g., interrupt storm, CAN controller fault, infinite loop in CAN TX). This is a low-probability event, especially with proper software watchdog and CAN error handling.

**Controllability C3**: The driver experiences the same loss of vehicle coordination as in HE-011. The babbling may not be immediately obvious to the driver (no physical symptom until vehicle control is lost). The driver cannot restore CAN communication. The E-stop (hardwired) and the Safety Controller (independent CAN monitor that can detect abnormal bus activity) are the only mitigation paths.

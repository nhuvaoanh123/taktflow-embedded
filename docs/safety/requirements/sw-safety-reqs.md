## Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Comment Lock

`HITL` means human-reviewer-owned comment content.

**Marker standard (code-friendly):**
- Markdown: `<!-- HITL-LOCK START:<id> -->` ... `<!-- HITL-LOCK END:<id> -->`
- C/C++/Java/JS/TS: `// HITL-LOCK START:<id>` ... `// HITL-LOCK END:<id>`
- Python/Shell/YAML/TOML: `# HITL-LOCK START:<id>` ... `# HITL-LOCK END:<id>`

**Rules:**
- AI must never edit, reformat, move, or delete text inside any `HITL-LOCK` block.
- Append-only: AI may add new comments/changes only; prior HITL comments stay unchanged.
- If a locked comment needs revision, add a new note outside the lock or ask the human reviewer to unlock it.

## Lessons Learned Rule

Every requirement (SSR-NNN) in this document that undergoes HITL review discussion MUST have its own lessons-learned file in [`docs/safety/lessons-learned/`](../lessons-learned/). One file per requirement (SSR-NNN). File naming: `SSR-NNN-<short-title>.md`.


# Software Safety Requirements

## 1. Purpose

This document specifies the software safety requirements (SSR) for the Taktflow Zonal Vehicle Platform, derived from the technical safety requirements (TSR) per ISO 26262-6 Clause 6. Software safety requirements define what the software on each ECU shall do to implement the technical safety requirements. Each SSR is allocated to a specific ECU and traces to one or more TSRs, enabling bidirectional traceability from safety goals through to source code and test cases.

## 2. Referenced Documents

## 3. Requirement Conventions

### 3.1 Requirement Structure

Each requirement follows the format:

- **ID**: SSR-{ECU}-NNN (e.g., SSR-CVC-001)
- **Title**: Descriptive name
- **ASIL**: Inherited from parent TSR
- **Traces up**: TSR-xxx
- **Traces down**: firmware/{ecu}/src/{file}:{function} (placeholder until implementation)
- **Verified by**: TC-{ECU}-xxx (placeholder test case IDs)
- **Status**: draft | reviewed | approved | implemented | verified

### 3.2 Naming Convention

SSR IDs are prefixed by the allocated ECU:
- `SSR-CVC-NNN` — Central Vehicle Computer
- `SSR-FZC-NNN` — Front Zone Controller
- `SSR-RZC-NNN` — Rear Zone Controller
- `SSR-SC-NNN` — Safety Controller

### 3.3 ASIL Inheritance

Each SSR inherits the ASIL of its parent TSR. Where an SSR traces to multiple TSRs, it inherits the highest ASIL.

## 4. CVC — Central Vehicle Computer Software Safety Requirements

### SSR-CVC-001: SPI1 Initialization for Dual Pedal Sensors

- **ASIL**: D
- **Traces up**: TSR-001
- **Traces down**: firmware/cvc/src/mcal/spi_cfg.c:Spi_Init()
- **Verified by**: TC-CVC-001
- **Status**: draft

The CVC software shall initialize SPI1 in master mode at 1 MHz clock, CPOL=0, CPHA=1 (matching AS5048A requirements). The software shall configure PA4 as chip-select for pedal sensor 1 and PA15 as chip-select for pedal sensor 2, both as GPIO outputs initialized to HIGH (deselected). The initialization shall verify SPI peripheral clock enable and confirm the SPI status register indicates idle state before returning success.

<!-- HITL-LOCK START:COMMENT-BLOCK-SSR-CVC-001 -->
**HITL Review (An Dao) — Reviewed: 2026-02-27:** Requirement specifies SPI1 initialization with correct AS5048A parameters (1 MHz, CPOL=0, CPHA=1) and dual chip-select configuration. ASIL D is correct per TSR-001. The CS pins initialized to HIGH (deselected) is correct SPI protocol. The status register idle check before returning success is good defensive design. Traces down to Spi_Init() are consistent. No gaps identified.

### SSR-CVC-002: Pedal Sensor SPI Read Cycle

- **ASIL**: D
- **Traces up**: TSR-001
- **Traces down**: firmware/cvc/src/swc/swc_pedal.c:Swc_Pedal_ReadSensors()
- **Verified by**: TC-CVC-002, TC-CVC-003
- **Status**: draft

The CVC software shall read both AS5048A pedal sensors sequentially within a single 10 ms control cycle. For each sensor: (a) assert the chip-select LOW, (b) transmit the 16-bit read command for the angle register (0x3FFF), (c) receive the 16-bit response, (d) de-assert chip-select HIGH, (e) validate the response parity bit and extract the 14-bit angle value. If the SPI transaction does not complete within 500 us (measured by a hardware timer), the software shall abort the transaction, de-assert chip-select, and retry once. If the retry also fails, the software shall set the sensor status to COMM_FAULT and use the last valid reading.

<!-- HITL-LOCK START:COMMENT-BLOCK-SSR-CVC-002 -->
**HITL Review (An Dao) — Reviewed: 2026-02-27:** Requirement specifies the SPI read sequence for both pedal sensors including parity validation, 500 us timeout, and single retry with fallback to COMM_FAULT. ASIL D is correct per TSR-001. The sequential reading within a single 10 ms cycle ensures both sensors are sampled close together for valid plausibility comparison. The hardware timer-based timeout and single retry are good for robustness. The COMM_FAULT with last-valid-value fallback is appropriate for a transient SPI failure. No gaps identified.

### SSR-CVC-003: Dual Pedal Sensor Plausibility Comparison

- **ASIL**: D
- **Traces up**: TSR-002
- **Traces down**: firmware/cvc/src/swc/swc_pedal.c:Swc_Pedal_CheckPlausibility()
- **Verified by**: TC-CVC-004, TC-CVC-005, TC-CVC-006
- **Status**: draft

The CVC software shall compare the 14-bit angle values from both pedal sensors every 10 ms. The software shall compute the absolute difference and compare it against the plausibility threshold (819 counts, representing 5% of the 16383-count full-scale range). The software shall maintain a debounce counter that increments each cycle the difference exceeds the threshold and resets to zero when the difference is within threshold. When the debounce counter reaches 2 (20 ms), the software shall set the pedal plausibility fault flag to TRUE and invoke the zero-torque reaction (SSR-CVC-006).

<!-- HITL-LOCK START:COMMENT-BLOCK-SSR-CVC-003 -->
**HITL Review (An Dao) — Reviewed: 2026-02-27:** Requirement specifies dual-sensor plausibility comparison with 819-count threshold (5% of 14-bit range) and 2-cycle (20 ms) debounce. ASIL D is correct per TSR-002. The 5% threshold is appropriate for AS5048A accuracy. The 20 ms debounce (2 cycles) is well within the SG-001 FTTI of 50 ms. The debounce counter reset on return to threshold is standard pattern. Traces to SSR-CVC-006 for fault reaction are consistent. No gaps identified.

### SSR-CVC-004: Pedal Sensor Stuck-at Detection

- **ASIL**: D
- **Traces up**: TSR-002
- **Traces down**: firmware/cvc/src/swc/swc_pedal.c:Swc_Pedal_CheckStuck()
- **Verified by**: TC-CVC-007, TC-CVC-008
- **Status**: draft

The CVC software shall detect a stuck pedal sensor by monitoring each sensor's value independently. If a sensor reading does not change by more than 10 counts (out of 16383) for 100 consecutive samples (1 second at 100 Hz), and the pedal is not physically at rest (other sensor shows movement), the software shall flag the stuck sensor as faulty and invoke the zero-torque reaction (SSR-CVC-006).

<!-- HITL-LOCK START:COMMENT-BLOCK-SSR-CVC-004 -->
**HITL Review (An Dao) — Reviewed: 2026-02-27:** Requirement specifies stuck-at detection (less than 10-count change for 100 samples = 1 second) with cross-reference to the other sensor for movement confirmation. ASIL D is correct per TSR-002. The "other sensor shows movement" condition prevents false stuck-at faults when the pedal is genuinely at rest -- this is a well-designed cross-check. The 1-second detection window is appropriate for stuck-at faults which are non-transient. Traces to SSR-CVC-006 for fault reaction are consistent. No gaps identified.

### SSR-CVC-005: Pedal Sensor Individual Diagnostics

- **ASIL**: D
- **Traces up**: TSR-003
- **Traces down**: firmware/cvc/src/swc/swc_pedal.c:Swc_Pedal_DiagCheck()
- **Verified by**: TC-CVC-009, TC-CVC-010
- **Status**: draft

The CVC software shall perform per-sensor diagnostic checks every 10 ms: (a) range check the 14-bit value against 0 to 16383, flagging exactly 0x0000 or 0x3FFF held for 3 consecutive cycles as stuck-at fault, (b) rate-of-change check against a maximum of 1000 counts per 10 ms cycle, flagging exceedance as a glitch fault, (c) read the AS5048A diagnostic register (0x3FFD) every 100 ms (10th cycle) and flag AGC out-of-range or CORDIC overflow as a sensor hardware fault. Each fault type shall be independently tracked and reported via the Dem module with a unique DTC.

<!-- HITL-LOCK START:COMMENT-BLOCK-SSR-CVC-005 -->
**HITL Review (An Dao) — Reviewed: 2026-02-27:** Requirement specifies three per-sensor diagnostic checks: range (0x0000/0x3FFF stuck-at), rate-of-change (1000 counts/cycle max), and AS5048A hardware diagnostics (AGC/CORDIC via register 0x3FFD every 100 ms). ASIL D is correct per TSR-003. Independent DTC tracking per fault type is good for diagnostics. The 3-cycle debounce on stuck-at-rail values prevents false positives from transient SPI errors. The 100 ms diagnostic register read interval matches the TSR specification. Traces to Dem module DTC reporting are consistent with the AUTOSAR-like BSW architecture. No gaps identified.

### SSR-CVC-006: Zero-Torque Latching on Pedal Fault

- **ASIL**: D
- **Traces up**: TSR-004
- **Traces down**: firmware/cvc/src/swc/swc_pedal.c:Swc_Pedal_FaultReaction()
- **Verified by**: TC-CVC-011, TC-CVC-012, TC-CVC-013
- **Status**: draft

Upon any pedal fault detection (plausibility, stuck, range, diagnostic), the CVC software shall: (a) set the internal torque request variable to 0 within 1 ms (same cycle as fault detection), (b) set a latching fault flag that prevents any non-zero torque request, (c) log a DTC via the Dem module with freeze-frame data (both sensor values, fault type, vehicle state). The latching fault flag shall only be cleared when the software verifies 50 consecutive fault-free cycles (500 ms) from both sensors AND receives a manual reset confirmation (E-stop release and re-engage sequence detected).

<!-- HITL-LOCK START:COMMENT-BLOCK-SSR-CVC-006 -->
**HITL Review (An Dao) — Reviewed: 2026-02-27:** Requirement specifies zero-torque latching with same-cycle (1 ms) reaction, DTC with freeze-frame data, and dual-condition recovery (500 ms fault-free + E-stop sequence). ASIL D is correct per TSR-004. The latching behavior prevents oscillation between fault and normal states. The freeze-frame data (both sensor values, fault type, vehicle state) is valuable for post-incident analysis. The dual recovery condition (sensor recovery + manual reset) is appropriately conservative. Traces to Dem module are consistent. No gaps identified.

### SSR-CVC-007: Zero-Torque CAN Transmission

- **ASIL**: D
- **Traces up**: TSR-004
- **Traces down**: firmware/cvc/src/swc/swc_torque.c:Swc_Torque_Transmit()
- **Verified by**: TC-CVC-014
- **Status**: draft

The CVC software shall transmit the torque request on CAN ID 0x100 every 10 ms with E2E protection. When the pedal fault flag is active (SSR-CVC-006), the torque request field in the CAN message shall be forced to 0% regardless of any other software state. The E2E alive counter shall continue to increment normally during fault conditions to enable the receiver (RZC) to distinguish between a valid zero-torque command and CAN communication loss.

<!-- HITL-LOCK START:COMMENT-BLOCK-SSR-CVC-007 -->
**HITL Review (An Dao) — Reviewed: 2026-02-27:** Requirement specifies forced zero-torque CAN transmission with continued E2E alive counter increment during fault. ASIL D is correct per TSR-004. The key insight is that the alive counter must continue incrementing during faults -- this enables the RZC to distinguish between a valid zero-torque command (alive counter incrementing) and CAN loss (alive counter missing). Without this, the RZC would fall back to its own safe default on CAN timeout. Both outcomes are safe, but the explicit zero command is cleaner. Traces to SSR-CVC-006 are consistent. No gaps identified.

### SSR-CVC-008: CAN E2E Protection — Transmit Side

- **ASIL**: D
- **Traces up**: TSR-022, TSR-023
- **Traces down**: firmware/cvc/src/bsw/e2e/e2e_protect.c:E2E_Protect()
- **Verified by**: TC-CVC-015, TC-CVC-016
- **Status**: draft

The CVC software shall implement the E2E protection transmit function for all safety-critical CAN messages. The function shall: (a) write the Data ID (4-bit, unique per message type) into byte 0 bits 3:0, (b) increment the alive counter (4-bit) by 1 (wrapping 0-15) and write it into byte 0 bits 7:4, (c) compute CRC-8 (polynomial 0x1D, initial value 0xFF) over bytes 2-7 concatenated with the Data ID byte, and (d) write the CRC result into byte 1. The function shall maintain a separate alive counter state per Data ID.

<!-- HITL-LOCK START:COMMENT-BLOCK-SSR-CVC-008 -->
**HITL Review (An Dao) — Reviewed: 2026-02-27:** Requirement specifies the E2E transmit function with correct bit field layout and CRC-8/SAE-J1850 computation. ASIL D is correct per TSR-022/TSR-023. The implementation specification is consistent with the header format defined in TSR-022. The per-Data-ID alive counter state is correctly specified. Traces to the shared BSW E2E module are consistent. This is a shared function across CVC, FZC, and RZC, so implementation-level consistency is critical. No gaps identified.

### SSR-CVC-009: CAN E2E Protection — Transmit Counter Management

- **ASIL**: D
- **Traces up**: TSR-023
- **Traces down**: firmware/cvc/src/bsw/e2e/e2e_protect.c:E2E_IncrementCounter()
- **Verified by**: TC-CVC-017
- **Status**: draft

The CVC software shall maintain an array of alive counters indexed by Data ID (16 entries for 4-bit Data ID). Each counter shall be initialized to 0 at startup. The counter shall be incremented exactly once per message transmission. The software shall verify that a counter is never incremented without a corresponding CAN transmission to prevent counter desynchronization.

<!-- HITL-LOCK START:COMMENT-BLOCK-SSR-CVC-009 -->
**HITL Review (An Dao) — Reviewed: 2026-02-27:** Requirement specifies alive counter array management (16 entries, initialized to 0, one increment per transmission). ASIL D is correct per TSR-023. The anti-desynchronization check (no increment without transmission) is a good defensive measure against software bugs. The 16-entry array matches the 4-bit Data ID space. Traces to E2E_IncrementCounter() are consistent. No gaps identified.
<!-- HITL-LOCK END:COMMENT-BLOCK-SSR-CVC-009 -->

### SSR-CVC-010: CAN E2E Protection — Receive Side

- **ASIL**: D
- **Traces up**: TSR-024
- **Traces down**: firmware/cvc/src/bsw/e2e/e2e_check.c:E2E_Check()
- **Verified by**: TC-CVC-018, TC-CVC-019, TC-CVC-020
- **Status**: draft

The CVC software shall implement the E2E protection receive function for all incoming safety-critical CAN messages. The function shall: (a) extract the alive counter and Data ID from byte 0, (b) recompute CRC-8 over bytes 2-7 plus Data ID and compare with byte 1, (c) verify the alive counter has incremented by exactly 1 from the previously received value for the same Data ID, (d) verify the Data ID matches the expected value for the CAN message ID. On any E2E check failure, the function shall return an error code. The caller shall use the last valid value for up to 1 cycle (10 ms); if 3 consecutive E2E failures occur, the caller shall substitute the safe default value (zero torque for torque messages, SAFE_STOP for state messages).

<!-- HITL-LOCK START:COMMENT-BLOCK-SSR-CVC-010 -->
**HITL Review (An Dao) — Reviewed: 2026-02-27:** Requirement specifies E2E receive function with four checks (alive counter, CRC, Data ID, sequence) and graduated fault reaction (1-cycle hold, then safe default after 3 failures). ASIL D is correct per TSR-024. The safe defaults (zero torque, SAFE_STOP) are appropriate fail-closed values. The 3-consecutive-failure threshold matches TSR-024. Traces to E2E_Check() are consistent. The error code return enables the caller to implement message-type-specific safe defaults, which is the correct separation of concerns between the E2E module and application logic. No gaps identified.

### SSR-CVC-011: CVC Heartbeat Transmission

- **ASIL**: C
- **Traces up**: TSR-025
- **Traces down**: firmware/cvc/src/swc/swc_heartbeat.c:Swc_Heartbeat_Transmit()
- **Verified by**: TC-CVC-021
- **Status**: draft

The CVC software shall transmit a heartbeat CAN message on CAN ID 0x010 every 50 ms. The message payload shall contain: ECU ID (0x01), operating mode (4-bit enum matching the vehicle state machine state), fault status bitmask (8-bit: bit 0 = pedal fault, bit 1 = CAN fault, bit 2 = NVM fault, bit 3 = WDT warning, bits 4-7 reserved), alive counter (4-bit), and CRC-8 (8-bit). Total: 4 bytes.

<!-- HITL-LOCK START:COMMENT-BLOCK-SSR-CVC-011 -->
**HITL Review (An Dao) — Reviewed: 2026-02-27:** Requirement specifies CVC heartbeat on CAN ID 0x010 at 50 ms with ECU ID, operating mode, fault bitmask, alive counter, and CRC-8. ASIL C is correct per TSR-025. The fault bitmask bit assignments (pedal, CAN, NVM, WDT) capture the CVC's key fault categories. The 4-byte payload fits within CAN 2.0B limits. Traces to Swc_Heartbeat_Transmit() are consistent. The operating mode mirroring the vehicle state machine state enables SC mode-aware monitoring. No gaps identified.

### SSR-CVC-012: CVC Heartbeat Conditioning on Self-Check

- **ASIL**: C
- **Traces up**: TSR-026
- **Traces down**: firmware/cvc/src/swc/swc_heartbeat.c:Swc_Heartbeat_CheckConditions()
- **Verified by**: TC-CVC-022, TC-CVC-023
- **Status**: draft

The CVC software shall suppress heartbeat transmission if any of the following conditions are detected: (a) the main loop iteration counter has not incremented since the last heartbeat (indicating a partial loop hang), (b) the stack canary value (a 32-bit magic number 0xDEADBEEF written at the bottom of the stack during initialization) does not match the expected value, (c) the CAN controller status register indicates bus-off state. When suppressed, the heartbeat is not transmitted, which will trigger SC heartbeat timeout detection.

<!-- HITL-LOCK START:COMMENT-BLOCK-SSR-CVC-012 -->
**HITL Review (An Dao) — Reviewed: 2026-02-27:** Requirement specifies heartbeat suppression on three conditions: loop hang, stack canary corruption, CAN bus-off. ASIL C is correct per TSR-026. The 0xDEADBEEF stack canary is a well-known sentinel value. The suppression-triggers-SC-detection pattern is consistent with the heartbeat conditioning concept from TSR-026. Traces to Swc_Heartbeat_CheckConditions() are consistent. The three conditions match those specified in TSR-026. No gaps identified.

### SSR-CVC-013: CVC External Watchdog Feed

- **ASIL**: D
- **Traces up**: TSR-031
- **Traces down**: firmware/cvc/src/swc/swc_watchdog.c:Swc_Watchdog_Feed()
- **Verified by**: TC-CVC-024, TC-CVC-025
- **Status**: draft

The CVC software shall toggle the TPS3823 WDI pin (configured GPIO) once per main loop iteration. The toggle shall only execute when all four conditions are satisfied: (a) main loop completed one full iteration (all runnables returned), (b) stack canary (0xDEADBEEF) intact at the bottom of the main task stack, (c) RAM test pattern (32-byte alternating 0xAA/0x55 pattern at reserved address) matches expected values after write-read-compare, (d) CAN controller not in bus-off state. The toggle shall alternate between HIGH and LOW on each invocation.

<!-- HITL-LOCK START:COMMENT-BLOCK-SSR-CVC-013 -->
**HITL Review (An Dao) — Reviewed: 2026-02-27:** Requirement specifies four-condition watchdog feed: loop completion, stack canary, RAM test, CAN status. ASIL D is correct per TSR-031. The four conditions match TSR-031 exactly. The 0xAA/0x55 alternating pattern for RAM test is standard and detects both stuck-at-0 and stuck-at-1 faults. The HIGH/LOW alternation ensures the TPS3823 WDI pin sees a transition (not just a level). Traces to Swc_Watchdog_Feed() are consistent. No gaps identified.

### SSR-CVC-014: CVC E-Stop GPIO Interrupt Handler

- **ASIL**: B

- **Traces down**: firmware/cvc/src/swc/swc_estop.c:Swc_EStop_IRQHandler()
- **Verified by**: TC-CVC-026, TC-CVC-027
- **Status**: draft

The CVC software shall configure GPIO PC13 as an external interrupt input (falling-edge triggered, internal pull-up enabled). The interrupt service routine shall: (a) read the GPIO pin state, (b) if LOW, start a 1 ms software timer for debounce confirmation, (c) after 1 ms, re-read the pin, (d) if still LOW, set the E-stop confirmed flag to TRUE, (e) set the torque request to 0 immediately within the ISR. The ISR shall be configured at the highest NVIC priority (priority 0) to ensure minimum latency.

<!-- HITL-LOCK START:COMMENT-BLOCK-SSR-CVC-014 -->
**HITL Review (An Dao) — Reviewed: 2026-02-27:** Requirement specifies E-stop ISR at highest NVIC priority with falling-edge trigger, 1 ms debounce re-read, and immediate zero-torque within ISR. ASIL B is correct per TSR-033. Setting torque to 0 within the ISR provides minimum reaction latency. The highest NVIC priority ensures the E-stop ISR cannot be preempted by any other interrupt. The 1 ms software timer debounce supplements the hardware RC debounce in TSR-033. Traces to Swc_EStop_IRQHandler() are consistent. Note: writing a shared variable (torque request) from ISR context requires volatile qualifier or atomic access to prevent data races with the main loop.

### SSR-CVC-015: CVC E-Stop CAN Broadcast

- **ASIL**: B
- **Traces up**: TSR-034
- **Traces down**: firmware/cvc/src/swc/swc_estop.c:Swc_EStop_Broadcast()
- **Verified by**: TC-CVC-028, TC-CVC-029
- **Status**: draft

Upon confirmed E-stop detection (SSR-CVC-014), the CVC software shall: (a) transition the vehicle state machine to SAFE_STOP, (b) transmit an E-stop CAN message on CAN ID 0x001 with E2E protection, containing the E-stop status (1 = active), alive counter, and CRC-8, (c) continue transmitting the E-stop message every 10 ms until the E-stop button is released (GPIO PC13 returns HIGH). The state machine shall remain in SAFE_STOP until the E-stop is released AND the operator performs a full restart sequence.

<!-- HITL-LOCK START:COMMENT-BLOCK-SSR-CVC-015 -->
**HITL Review (An Dao) — Reviewed: 2026-02-27:** Requirement specifies E-stop CAN broadcast on ID 0x001, 10 ms repeat, with SAFE_STOP latching until release + restart. ASIL B is correct per TSR-034. The CAN ID 0x001 matches TSR-034 for highest bus priority. The 10 ms repeated transmission provides redundancy. The latching SAFE_STOP with restart requirement matches TSR-034. Traces to Swc_EStop_Broadcast() are consistent. No gaps identified.

### SSR-CVC-016: Vehicle State Machine Transition Logic

- **Verified by**: TC-CVC-030, TC-CVC-031, TC-CVC-032, TC-CVC-033
- **Status**: draft

The CVC software shall implement the vehicle state machine as a lookup table indexed by (current_state, event) returning the next_state. The table shall be a const array in flash memory (not modifiable at runtime). The state machine function shall: (a) validate the current state is within the enum range (0-5), (b) validate the event is within the enum range, (c) look up the transition in the table, (d) if the entry is INVALID_TRANSITION, log the attempted transition as a DTC and return the current state unchanged, (e) if valid, execute the transition, update the current state, and invoke the state-entry actions for the new state. The function shall enforce E-stop override: if the event is E_STOP, transition to SAFE_STOP from any state. The function shall enforce SC override: if the event is SC_KILL, transition to SHUTDOWN from any state.

<!-- HITL-LOCK START:COMMENT-BLOCK-SSR-CVC-016 -->
**HITL Review (An Dao) — Reviewed: 2026-02-27:** Requirement specifies const flash-based transition table with input validation, DTC logging for invalid transitions, and E-stop/SC override enforcement. ASIL D is correct per TSR-035. The const array in flash prevents runtime modification of the transition table, which is critical for safety. The enum range validation prevents array out-of-bounds access. The E-stop and SC override rules ensure safety mechanisms cannot be blocked by the state machine. Traces to Swc_State_ProcessEvent() are consistent. This is a well-designed deterministic state machine implementation.

The CVC software shall execute the following entry actions upon transitioning to each state:

- **INIT**: Begin self-test sequence, enable OLED, set torque limit to 0%.
- **RUN**: Set torque limit to 100%, speed limit to 100%, clear warning displays.
- **DEGRADED**: Set torque limit to 75%, speed limit to 50%, display warning on OLED, send DEGRADED state on CAN.
- **LIMP**: Set torque limit to 30%, speed limit to 20%, display LIMP warning on OLED, send LIMP state on CAN.
- **SAFE_STOP**: Set torque to 0%, disable motor via CAN, request brakes via CAN, display STOP on OLED, store state to NVM (SSR-CVC-019).
- **SHUTDOWN**: Set all outputs to safe default, store final DTCs, stop feeding watchdog.

On any lidar fault (timeout, range, stuck, signal strength), the FZC software shall: (a) substitute distance = 0 cm (triggers emergency zone per SSR-FZC-012), (b) log a DTC via Dem with fault type and last valid reading, (c) if fault persists for 200 consecutive cycles (2 seconds), transmit a degradation request to CVC via CAN. The safe default of 0 cm is fail-closed: sensor failure causes the system to assume the worst case (obstacle at minimum distance).

**HITL Review (An Dao) — Reviewed: 2026-02-27:** Requirement specifies fault LED management with three states per ECU (ON/BLINK/OFF) and system fault LED (GIO_A4) for cross-plausibility or self-test failures. ASIL B is correct per TSR-045. The BLINK state (500 ms period) for degraded ECUs distinguishes degraded from timed-out (solid ON), providing useful diagnostic information. The 10 ms update period ensures responsive LED state changes. The LED assignment (GIO_A1-A3 per ECU, GIO_A4 system) matches SSR-SC-004 and SSR-SC-012. Traces to SC_LED_Update() are consistent. No gaps identified.

### SSR-SC-014: SC FTTI Monitoring

- **ASIL**: D
- **Traces up**: TSR-046
- **Traces down**: firmware/sc/src/sc_main.c:SC_Main_Loop()
- **Verified by**: TC-SC-026
- **Status**: draft

The SC main loop shall execute at a 10 ms period. Each iteration shall execute in the following order: (a) receive and validate CAN messages, (b) update heartbeat timeout counters, (c) perform cross-plausibility check, (d) evaluate relay trigger conditions, (e) update fault LEDs, (f) feed watchdog. The total loop execution time shall not exceed 2 ms to maintain the 10 ms cycle with adequate margin. The SC shall use a hardware timer to measure loop execution time and flag an overrun DTC if any iteration exceeds 5 ms.

<!-- HITL-LOCK START:COMMENT-BLOCK-SSR-SC-014 -->
**HITL Review (An Dao) — Reviewed: 2026-02-27:** Requirement specifies SC 10 ms main loop with six ordered steps and 2 ms WCET budget (5 ms overrun threshold). ASIL D is correct per TSR-046. The execution order is correct: receive-first ensures fresh data, then monitoring, then actuation, then diagnostics, then watchdog feed last (proving the full loop completed). The 2 ms target with 5 ms overrun threshold provides 50% margin to the 10 ms cycle. As noted in SSR-A-002, the SC runs bare-metal (no RTOS), so this is a cooperative main loop period, not an RTOS task. The hardware timer measurement enables runtime WCET monitoring. Traces to SC_Main_Loop() are consistent. No gaps identified.

### SSR-SC-015: SC Backup Motor Cutoff via Kill Relay

- **ASIL**: D
- **Traces up**: TSR-049
- **Traces down**: firmware/sc/src/sc_plausibility.c:SC_Plausibility_BackupCutoff()
- **Verified by**: TC-SC-027, TC-SC-028
- **Status**: draft

The SC software shall monitor for the brake-fault-motor-cutoff scenario: if the FZC heartbeat fault bitmask indicates a brake fault (bit 1), and the RZC motor current remains above 1000 mA for 100 ms after the brake fault is reported, the SC shall conclude that the CVC-RZC motor cutoff chain has failed and shall de-energize the kill relay (SSR-SC-007). This provides a hardware-enforced backup for the software motor cutoff path.

<!-- HITL-LOCK START:COMMENT-BLOCK-SSR-SC-015 -->
**HITL Review (An Dao) — Reviewed: 2026-02-27:** Requirement specifies SC backup motor cutoff via kill relay when FZC reports brake fault and RZC motor current remains above 1000 mA for 100 ms. ASIL D is correct per TSR-049. This is a critical defense-in-depth mechanism -- if the CVC-to-RZC motor cutoff command fails (software path), the SC provides hardware-enforced backup via the kill relay. The 100 ms monitoring window allows time for the normal software cutoff path to work before escalating to kill relay. The 1000 mA threshold distinguishes between motor running and motor stopped. Traces to SC_Plausibility_BackupCutoff() are consistent. No gaps identified.

### SSR-SC-016: SC Startup Self-Test Sequence

- **ASIL**: C
- **Traces up**: TSR-050
- **Traces down**: firmware/sc/src/sc_selftest.c:SC_SelfTest_Startup()
- **Verified by**: TC-SC-029, TC-SC-030, TC-SC-031
- **Status**: draft

The SC software shall execute the following self-test sequence at power-on before energizing the kill relay:

1. Trigger lockstep CPU built-in self-test via ESM and verify no error flag set.
2. Execute PBIST (Programmable Built-In Self-Test) for RAM covering the full 256 KB.
3. Compute CRC-32 over application flash (0x00000000 to end of application) and compare with reference CRC stored in the last flash sector.
4. Initialize DCAN1 in loopback mode, transmit a test frame, verify reception, then switch to listen-only mode.
5. Drive GIO_A0 through GIO_A4 to known states and read back via data-in registers.
6. Illuminate all 4 fault LEDs for 500 ms (lamp test).
7. Toggle TPS3823 WDI and verify RESET pin is de-asserted.

If any test fails, set GIO_A4 to blink at the test step number (1 blink = step 1, etc.) and halt. Do not energize kill relay.

<!-- HITL-LOCK START:COMMENT-BLOCK-SSR-SC-016 -->
**HITL Review (An Dao) — Reviewed: 2026-02-27:** Requirement specifies a 7-step startup self-test sequence before kill relay energize: lockstep BIST, PBIST (256 KB RAM), flash CRC-32, DCAN1 loopback, GPIO readback (GIO_A0-A4), lamp test (500 ms), and watchdog toggle. ASIL C is correct per TSR-050. The sequence order is logical: CPU first, then memory, then flash integrity, then peripherals, then visual confirmation. The DCAN1 loopback test verifies CAN functionality before switching to listen-only mode. The lamp test provides visual confirmation that all LEDs work. The blink-count error indication (step number) enables field diagnostics without serial debug. The halt-on-failure behavior (no relay energize) ensures the vehicle cannot start with a failed SC. Traces to SC_SelfTest_Startup() are consistent. No gaps identified.

### SSR-SC-017: SC Runtime Periodic Self-Test

- **ASIL**: C
- **Traces up**: TSR-051
- **Traces down**: firmware/sc/src/sc_selftest.c:SC_SelfTest_Runtime()
- **Verified by**: TC-SC-032, TC-SC-033
- **Status**: draft

The SC software shall execute a runtime self-test every 60 seconds: (a) recompute flash CRC-32 and compare with reference (spread over 6 seconds to avoid blocking the main loop — compute 1/60th per main loop iteration), (b) write/read/compare a 32-byte test pattern to a reserved RAM region, (c) check DCAN1 status register for bus-off or error passive, (d) read back GIO_A0 and verify it matches the commanded relay state. If any test fails, invoke relay de-energize (SSR-SC-007).

<!-- HITL-LOCK START:COMMENT-BLOCK-SSR-SC-017 -->
**HITL Review (An Dao) — Reviewed: 2026-02-27:** Requirement specifies four runtime self-tests every 60 seconds: flash CRC-32 (spread over 6 seconds to avoid blocking), RAM pattern write/read/compare, DCAN1 status check, and GIO_A0 readback. ASIL C is correct per TSR-051. The flash CRC spreading (1/60th per iteration over 6 seconds) is a well-designed approach that prevents blocking the 10 ms main loop -- each iteration processes approximately 1/600th of flash at the 10 ms loop rate. The RAM test pattern (32-byte 0xAA/0x55) detects stuck-at faults in the reserved region. The GIO_A0 readback confirms relay state matches commanded state. Relay de-energize on any failure via SSR-SC-007 is appropriate. Traces to SC_SelfTest_Runtime() are consistent. No gaps identified.

## Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Comment Lock

`HITL` means human-reviewer-owned comment content.

**Marker standard (code-friendly):**
- Markdown: `<!-- HITL-LOCK START:<id> -->` ... `<!-- HITL-LOCK END:<id> -->`
- C/C++/Java/JS/TS: `// HITL-LOCK START:<id>` ... `// HITL-LOCK END:<id>`
- Python/Shell/YAML/TOML: `# HITL-LOCK START:<id>` ... `# HITL-LOCK END:<id>`

**Rules:**
- AI must never edit, reformat, move, or delete text inside any `HITL-LOCK` block.
- Append-only: AI may add new comments/changes only; prior HITL comments stay unchanged.
- If a locked comment needs revision, add a new note outside the lock or ask the human reviewer to unlock it.


# Audit Evidence Package — Taktflow Embedded Platform

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Document ID** | AEP-001 |
| **Standard** | ISO 26262:2018 (ASIL D) + Automotive SPICE 4.0 |
| **Date** | 2026-02-24 |
| **Status** | Interim (portfolio demonstration) |

## Executive Summary

The Taktflow Embedded Platform is a 7-ECU zonal vehicle architecture comprising 4 physical microcontrollers (STM32 and TMS570) and 3 simulated ECUs running in Docker containers. The platform implements an AUTOSAR-like Base Software (BSW) stack, CAN bus communication with E2E protection, and targets ASIL D safety integrity per ISO 26262:2018. This document serves as the master evidence index for the complete safety evidence package, guiding an assessor from concept-phase safety analysis through implementation and verification.

## Assessor Notes

1. This is a **portfolio project** demonstrating ASIL D development capability across the full V-model lifecycle. It is not a production vehicle system.
2. **No external independent assessment (I3)** has been performed. ISO 26262 requires I3-level independence for ASIL D functional safety assessments; this would be provided by a certification body (e.g., TUV, SGS, exida) in a production programme.
3. **PIL/HIL testing** requires physical hardware targets and is out of scope for this portfolio demonstration. The SIL layer provides the highest level of automated verification achievable without physical ECUs.
4. **Safety validation at vehicle level** (ISO 26262 Part 4) requires a physical system operating in its intended environment. The safety validation report documents the validation strategy for a production context.
5. All evidence is maintained under Git version control with CI enforcement, providing full change history and baseline management per ASPICE SUP.8.
